# Visite Manaus
This project is a static website, one of my first using only HTML and CSS. It invites visitors to discover Manaus, located in the heart of the Amazon. The site covers the city's history and culture, from its founding to its modernization with the Free Trade Zone. It highlights the main tourist attractions and features a photo gallery showcasing the beauty and diversity of Manaus.
